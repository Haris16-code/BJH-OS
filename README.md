# 💻 BJH OS

Hi everyone! 👋 I'm a college student — my name is **Muhammad Haris** and I made a **web-based operating system** named **BJH OS** 🌐💡

**BJH OS** is a **browser-based operating system** developed using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend dependencies ⚙️🚫. It’s designed to give you the feel of a real desktop OS, but in your web browser 🖥️✨
